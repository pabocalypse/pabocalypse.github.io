For writing this blog, my current workflow is as below:

- Idea or something I am doing that might be nice to post
- Write notes in Joplin
- Flesh out in Joplin
- Migrate over to a post for site
- Archive in Joplin
- Cleanup markdown in VSCode
- Check via building site to make sure it is all good
- Publish

The things I am going to cover here are the various tools I use and why. These
are:

- [Joplin][joplin]
- [Typora][typora]
- [MarkText][marktext]
  - This hasn't had development done in a while so I am looking for other very
    simple markdown editors like Typora.
- [VSCode][vscode]

## Joplin

I use Joplin because I can easily sync the data between devices either with
Joplin Cloud, Dropbox, One Drive, File system, NextCloud, WebDav, S3 (in beta
currently), and Joplin Server (also beta). The reason I use Joplin to do this
syncing rather than say flat files on disk is to do with how I want to interact
with them. I am yet to have it fail on me, but I do know that some people prefer
it to just be a file on disk. The reason I don't want this is that I don't want
to restricted on file names for the content. I am happy having it stored
randomly instead and having a line in the file say what the subject is.

## MarkText / Typora

When editing on a laptop or desktop, these are the current text editors that I
use. The reason for this is that you can then make them very basic as a view. No
side bar, minimal plugins, not in a terminal (sorry [vim][vim] /
[neovim][neovim] / [emacs][emacs]), and most importantly for me I don't use them
for any other purpose than writing text. If I was to use something web based, or
something like VSCode for the main writing then I would get distracted and do
something else such as browse reddit, or write some code. I could probably get
VSCode to a point where it is more minimal for writing the main text, but it is
not something I have explored yet.

## VSCode

VSCode is when I get to finishing writing a post, that I move it into there.
This is mainly due to all the plugins that are available as well as that I am
going to be pushing it to the site via Git. The plugins I use include
[Rewrap][vscode-plugin-rewrap], [Markdown Table
Prettifier][vscode-plugin-markdown-table-prettifier], and
[markdownlint][vscode-plugin-markdownlint]. These are mainly for formatting
markdown into something that easier to read in a raw format: Rewrap - to 80
characters a line, table prettifier to make the tables the same length per line,
and markdown lint is just to have formatting consistent.

## Final Thoughts

Whilst for me this workflow works quite well, I understand that many people have
different ways to write their posts, and what different formatting to the end
file. Some people will not mind that the markdown paragraphs are all on one
line, and for others it'll drive them crazy. At the end of the day, these tools
all share one thing in common which is I am writing markdown. If it came down to
it, I could just do that in notepad on a Windows machine.

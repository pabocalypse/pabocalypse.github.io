Now that I am using iOS via an iPad, there was a reason for fixing up the
[ntfy][ntfy] notifications on iOS devices. I didn’t get it working before. Why?
Essentially boils down to a typo and nothing more. I’ll get to what the typo
was, and the importance of rtfm.

## Why ntfy?

It’s a notification system that you can self host. If you use android, you can
use it without having the rely on the upstream server, but on iOS you may wish
to configure some items so that notifications work more instantly on the device.
You can use other services such as [PushBullet][pushbullet], [Discord][discord],
[Telegram][telegram], and [Signal][signal] to get notifications to your devices
as well, but some of these get cluttered due to their main purpose being for
instant messaging instead.

## RTFM, and the Typo

Now for what the bug was. If you read this [page][ntfy-docs] it gives you two
things to check for if you stop getting notifications on iOS. These are as
follows:

- Make sure `base-url` is your actual base-url. This is the same as what the
  default server is on the iOS device.
  - If you are serving it out on `https://ntfy.example.com` then this would be
    `https://ntfy.example.com`.
- Make sure that `upstream-base-url` is exactly `https://ntfy.sh` with no
  slashes at the end.

My issue? Well it was my `base-url` was `http://` rather than `https://`. That
was it. I wasn’t able to get notifications in a timely manor due a `s` being
missing.
